                                    with you or if it can't hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds

                                    <br />
                                    On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you for the next 8 hours, or
                                    until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw.
                                    It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain
                                    no knowledge of the secret.

                                    The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret.
                                    It won't risk its life for you, or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to

                                        feet of that creature. The mote is intangi­ble and invulnerable, and it lasts

                                        thunderously shatters. The target and each creature of your choice that you can

                                        As an action, you can target a Large or smaller non­magical item you can see
                                        within 30 feet of you and animate it. The animate item uses the Dancing Item
                                        stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB). The item is friendly to you
                                        and your companions and obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is
                                        reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In combat, the item shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn
                                        immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the
                                        only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus
                                        action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one
                                        in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapaci­tated, the item can
                                        take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the item as part
                                        of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once you animate an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you
                                        finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use
                                        this feature again. You can have only one item ani­mated by this feature at a
                                        time; if you use this action and already have a dancing item from this feature,
                                        the first one immediately becomes inanimate.

                                        The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See
                                        this creature's game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit stat block, which uses
                                        your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the spirit's
                                        appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled
                                        branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.

                                    <p>
                                        In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn
                                        immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge
                                        action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to com­mand it to take
                                        another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action.
                                        If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just
                                        Dodge.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you
                                        use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.

                                    You learn a ritual that creates a magic bond between yourself and

                                    perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done
                                    during a short rest.
                                    The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the
                                    conclusion of
                                    which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

                                    unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of
                                    existence, you can
                                    summon that weapon as a bonus action, causing it to teleport to your
                                    hand.

                                    bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must

                                    bond with one of the other two.

                                    wide and 30 feet
                                    long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through

                                    piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much

                                        of you with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one

                                        your mind. As an action, you target one loose object that is Large or smaller or
                                        one willing creature, other than yourself. If you can see the target and it is
                                        within 30 feet of you, you can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you
                                        can see. Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you can move it to or from your
                                        hand. Either way, you can move the target horizontally, vertically, or both.
                                        Once you take this action, you can't do so again un­til you finish a short or
                                        long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.

                                        objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield,
                                        a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune

                                    <p>The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a

                                        rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC <emph>equals 8

                                        <emph>Cloud Rune. </emph>This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some
                                        cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you
                                        have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception)
                                        checks. <br /> In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of
                                        you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and
                                        choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The
                                        chosen creature becomes the tar­get of the attack, using the same roll. This
                                        magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once
                                        you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long

                                        of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune,
                                        your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your
                                        proficiency with a tool. <br /> In addition, when you hit a creature with an
                                        at­tack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the
                                        target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving
                                        throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the
                                        target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can
                                        repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles
                                        on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish
                                        a short or long rest.

                                        in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an
                                        object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling)
                                        checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks. <br /> In addition, you can invoke
                                        the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain
                                        a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or
                                        Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you fin­ish

                                        <emph>Stone Rune. </emph>This rune's magic channels the judi­ciousness
                                        associated with stone giants. While wear­ing or carrying an object inscribed
                                        with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have
                                        darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. <br />In addition, when a creature you
                                        can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke
                                        the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save
                                        succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this
                                        way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a
                                        dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its
                                        turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do
                                        so again until you finish a short or long rest.

                                        <emph>Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher). </emph>This rune's magic bestows a
                                        resilience reminiscent of a hill gi­ant. While wearing or carrying an object
                                        that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being
                                        poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.<br />In addition, you
                                        can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning,
                                        piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can't
                                        do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

                                        the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing or carrying an object
                                        inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks,
                                        and you can't be surprised as long as you aren't incapacitated.<br />In
                                        addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state
                                        for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or
                                        another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a
                                        saving throw, or an abil­ity check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll
                                        to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so
                                        again until you finish a short or long rest.

                                    do not need to
                                    provide material components.

                                    one weapon that you are holding with positive energy. This effect
                                    lasts for 1
                                    minute. For the duration, you add your Charisma modifier (minimum
                                    +1) to attack
                                    rolls made with that weapon. The weapon also emits bright light in a
                                    20-foot radius,
                                    and dim light for 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already
                                    magical, it
                                    becomes magical for the duration.

                                    You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If

                                    longer holding or carrying the weapon, or if you fall unconscious,
                                    the effect ends.

                                    fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes

                                    can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.
                                    It also can't
                                    take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or
                                    try to escape
                                    from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to
                                    move, the
                                    creature can use the Dodge action.

                                    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
                                    from you as it
                                    can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.
                                    It also can't
                                    take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or
                                    try to escape
                                    from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to
                                    move, the
                                    creature can use the Dodge action.
                                    <br />
                                    If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion,
                                    shapeshifting, or other
                                    effect, its true form is revealed while it is turned.

                                        end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. For its action, it can use only

                                    At the DM's discretion, it may be possible for an Oathbreaker paladin to atone. This
                                    is done by shedding your Evil alignment, and demonstrating such through words and
                                    deeds. Having done so, you may choose a deity and a new Sacred Oath.

                                        While wandering the wilds, a ranger encounters many sorts of animals, some of
                                        which the ranger might befriend. This friendship can arise from successful use
                                        of the Animal Handling skill or the animal friendship spell. If the resulting
                                        bond is strong enough, the animal might join the ranger on adventures.

                                        A ranger who has the Beast Master archetype can form an even stronger bond,
                                        feeling almost like a sibling to an animal. A special type of beast awaits a
                                        Beast Master in the wilds, a creature whose lineage stretches back to the
                                        beginnings of the world: a primal beast known as a Beast of the Air or a Beast
                                        of the Earth. Such a creature seeks out the type of companionship that a Beast
                                        Master offers, ready for the two of them to battle the imbalances in the natural
                                        world.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The primal beast is a special creature that a Beast Master can choose for the
                                        Ranger’s Companion feature. When choosing such a creature, you decide whether it
                                        is a Beast of the Air or the Earth, and you determine its appearance. Stories
                                        describe primal beasts that mystically change form to align with the spirit of
                                        their companion.

                                        When a primal beast is met apart from a Beast Master, the creature takes the
                                        form a regular beast of challenge rating 1/4 or lower, as determined by the DM.

                                        speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To
                                        send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must
                                        be within 1 mile of each other. A crea­ture can't use this telepathy if it can't
                                        speak any lan­guages, and a creature can end the telepathic con­nection at any
                                        time (no action required). You and the creature don't need to speak a common
                                        language to understand each other. <br />The first time you use this power after
                                        each long rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy die. All other times you use
                                        the power, you expend the die.

                                    target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to

                                    The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target.
                                    Additionally,
                                    while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has
                                    Disadvantage on
                                    saving throws against any spell you cast.

                                    The hound disappears if it is reduce to 0 hit points, if its target

                                    hit points, or after 5 minutes.

                                        You summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As an action, you
                                        summon the spirits in a 30-foot cube originating from you. The spirits look like
                                        modrons or other constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and
                                        invulnerable, and they create the following effects within the cube before
                                        vanishing:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The spirits restore up to 100 hit points, divided as you choose among any
                                            number of creatures of your choice in the cube. </li>
                                        <li>Any damaged objects entirely in the cube are re­paired instantly.</li>
                                        <li>Every spell of 6th level or lower ends on creatures and objects of your
                                            choice in the cube.</li>

                                        unless you spend 7 sorcery points to use it again.

                                        can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so
                                        when you finish a long rest.
                                    </p>

                                        Whenever you cast this spell, your patron's magic bolsters you, granting you a
                                        number of temporary hit points <emph>equal to your warlock level</emph>.
                                        Moreover, damage can't break your concentration on this spell.

                                    <br />
                                    <emph>Bottled Respite. </emph>As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your
                                    vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an
                                    extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and
                                    resem­bles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and
                                    is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel
                                    as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of
                                    hours <emph>equal to 2 &times; your proficiency bonus</emph>. You exit the vessel
                                    early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed.
                                    When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any
                                    objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is
                                    destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces
                                    closest to the vessel's former space.
                                    <br />
                                    Once you enter the vessel, you can’t enter again until you finish a long rest.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <emph>Genie's Wrath. </emph>Once during each of your turns when you hit with an
                                    attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your proficiency
                                    bonus. The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao),
                                    thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    The vessel’s AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your warlock level
                                    plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.
                                    <br />
                                    If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to
                                    receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a
                                    short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The
                                    vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.

                                    Your body is now simply a vessel for your spirit. As an action, you can project your
                                    spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of
                                    suspended animation.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your
                                    concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends,
                                    your spirit returns to your body or your body magically teleports to your spirit’s
                                    space (your choice).
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
                                            damage.</li>
                                        <li>When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell
                                            doesn’t require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold
                                            cost.</li>
                                        <li>You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can
                                            move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but
                                            you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an
                                            object.</li>
                                        <li>While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when
                                            you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half
                                            the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

                                        You can invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't
                                        wearing me­dium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with

                                        You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It
                                        ends early if you are in­capacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a
                                        shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also
                                        dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

                                            your spellbook magically alters the spell’s formula for this casting. The
                                            latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.</li>
                                        <li>When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell’s normal
                                            casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this
                                            benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</li>

                                        If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using

                                        spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet
                                        of you. The spec­tral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it
                                        sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of
                                        text, or a scholar from the past (your choice).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with
                                        a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and
                                        hears (no action required).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in
                                        the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so
                                        a number of times per day <emph>equal to your proficiency bonus</emph>, and you
                                        regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an
                                        unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not
                                        objects.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from
                                        you, if someone casts <emph>dispel magic</emph> on it, if the Awakened Spellbook
                                        is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest,
                                        unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.

                                        Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from
                                        your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be
                                        within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1
                                        action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level
                                        higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an
                                        action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell van­ishes
                                        from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.

                                        must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill.

                                        Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul
                                        has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have
                                        advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, as the spellbook helps you
                                        remember magical lore.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Moreover, if you take damage while your spell­book's mind is manifested, you can
                                        prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dis­miss the
                                        spectral mind, using its magic to save your­self. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook
                                        temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal
                                        to that roll or higher. For example, if the rail's total is 9, spells vanish
                                        from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one
                                        9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there
                                        aren't enough spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Until you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells,
                                        even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the
                                        required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spellbook.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

                                    You can invest a spark of magic into objects that would otherwise be mundane. To use
                                    this feature, you must have thieves' tools, tinker's tools, or other artisan's tools
                                    in hand.

                                    As an action, you touch a Tiny nonmagical object and give it one of the following
                                    magical properties of your choice:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an
                                            additional 5 feet.</li>
                                        <li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can
                                            be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this
                                            property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds
                                            long.</li>
                                        <li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound
                                            (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable
                                            up to 10 feet away.</li>
                                        <li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect
                                            can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of
                                            these elements, as you like.</li>

                                    The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and
                                    end the property early.
                                    <br />
                                    You can give the magic of this feature to multiple objects, touching one object each
                                    time you use the feature, and a single object can bear only one of the properties at
                                    a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with the feature at one time is
                                    <emph>equal to your Intelligence modifier</emph> (minimum of one object). If you try
                                    to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new
                                    property applies.

                                    <emph>Infusing an Item. </emph>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a
                                    nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your Artificer infusions, turning it into
                                    a magic item.
                                    <br />
                                    An infusion works only on certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's
                                    description.
                                    <br />
                                    If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you
                                    infuse it, or you can forgo attunement so that someone else can attune to the item.
                                    If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so normally.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion
                                    vanishes after a number of days <emph>equal to your Intelligence modifier</emph>
                                    (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the
                                    infusion for another one.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the
                                    maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer
                                    table.
                                    You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one
                                    object at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest
                                    infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.
                                    <br />
                                    If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a <em>bag of
                                        holding</em>, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

                                        You learn intricate methods for magically creating a special homunculus that
                                        serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the
                                        creature's body instantly forms.
                                        <br />
                                        The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your
                                        commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the statblock below, which uses
                                        your Proficiency Bonus (PB) in several places.

                                        You determine the homunculus’s appearance, which includes wings and bits of
                                        alchemical equipment. Some alchemists prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas
                                        others like winged vials or miniature cauldrons.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn
                                        immediately after yours.
                                        <br />
                                        The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a
                                        bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat
                                        block or some other action.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        If the <emph>Mending</emph> spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points.
                                        <br />
                                        If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space.

                                    Using this infusion, you replicate a particular magic item. You can learn this
                                    infusion multiple times; each time you do so, choose a different magic item you can
                                    make with it, picking from the Replicable Magic Items tables below.

                                    In the tables, an item's entry tells you whether the item requires attunement.

                                    Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magi­cally produce an experimental elixir

                                    effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature
                                    can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapaci­tated creature.

                                    You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st
                                    level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the
                                    elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the
                                    Experimental Elixir table.

                                    Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your
                                    person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until
                                    the end of your next long rest.

                                    When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of
                                    a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect
                                    separately. Each elixir requires its own flask.

                                        As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor,
                                        provided you have smith's tools in hand.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks
                                            this requirement for you.</li>
                                        <li>You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer
                                            spells</li>
                                        <li>The armor attaches to you and can't be removed against your will. It also
                                            expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the
                                            helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning
                                            identically to a limb it replaces.</li>
                                        <li>You can doff or don the armor as an action.</li>

                                    The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you
                                    die.

                                        You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following
                                        armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special
                                        benefits while you wear it.
                                        <br />
                                        Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can
                                        add your Intelli­gence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack
                                        and damage rolls.
                                        <br />
                                        You can change the armor's model whenever you finish a short or long rest,

                                    <h5>Guardian</h5>You design your armor to be in the front line of combat. It has the

                                    <br />

                                    <emph>Thunder Gauntlets. </emph>Each of the armor's gauntlets counts as a simple
                                    melee weapon while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 Thunder
                                    damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has Disadvantage on attack rolls
                                    against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the ar­mor
                                    magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.

                                    you al­ready have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor. You
                                    can use this bonus action a number of times <emph>equal to your proficiency bonus
                                    </emph>, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

                                    <emph>Lightning Launcher. </emph>A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists
                                    or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal
                                    range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 Lightning damage on
                                    a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a crea­ture with it, you can deal an
                                    extra 1d6 Lightning damage to that target.
                                    <br />
                                    <emph>Powered Steps. </emph>Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.

                                    <emph>Dampening Field. </emph>you have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If
                                    the armor normally imposes Disadvantage on such checks, the Advantage and
                                    Disadvantage cancel each other out, as normal.

                                        Tiny one can be held in one hand. </p>
                                    <p>Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or
                                        until you expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one can­non at a
                                        time and can't create one while your can­non is present. </p>
                                    <p>The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18
                                        and a number of hit points <emph>equal to five times your artificer level</emph>

                                        ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+O). If the
                                        <em>mending</em> spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disap­pears
                                        if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an

                                    <p>When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs.
                                        You also de­cide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch
                                        Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the
                                        cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus
                                        action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an
                                        unoccupied space, provided it has legs. </p>

                                        action on your turn to com­mand it to take another action. That action can be
                                        one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the
                                        defender can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

                                        If the <em>mending</em> spell is cast on the defender, it regains 2d6 hit
                                        points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as
                                        an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a
                                        spell slot of 1st level or higher. The defender returns to life after 1 minute
                                        with all its hit points restored.

                                        At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel defender if you have
                                        smith's tools with you. If you already have a defender from this feature, the
                                        first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if you die.

                                            Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points
