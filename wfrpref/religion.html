                        <h3>The Blessed</h3>
                        <p>
                            A small number of the faithful stand apart from their peers, seemingly able to appeal for
                            their deity’s direct intervention in the form of miracles. Those who perform such feats are
                            known by many names in different parts of the Old World — including: Living Saints, Gods’
                            Servants, The Hallowed, Divine Wills, Anointed Ones — but, in the Empire, they are most
                            commonly referred to as ‘Blessed’, which is often used as a title. So, if Sister Anna where
                            to be Blessed by Sigmar — i.e. granted Sigmar’s grace, able to have her prayers answered —
                            she would become ‘Blessed Anna’, or, in full, ‘Blessed Anna, Sister of Sigmar’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are two Talents that specifically mark out those Blessed by the gods: <talent>Bless
                            </talent> and <talent>Invoke</talent>. Characters with the <talent>Bless</talent> Talent may
                            enact Blessings, which are minor manifestations of divine will, while the <talent>Invoke
                            </talent> Talent allows the Blessed to call on their gods for more powerful Miracles. For
                            more on these Talents, see Chapter 4: Skills and Talents.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Blessings and Miracles</h3>
                        <p>
                            Blessing and Miracles are prayers spoken by one of the Blessed, and then empowered by a god.
                            To enact a Blessing or Miracle, make a <b>Challenging (+0) Pray Test</b>. If you score a
                            Success, your Blessing or Miracle manifests according to its rules, and a high SL will give
                            you bonus effects. If you score a Failure, your words are spoken, but your god, for whatever
                            reason, refuses to listen. If you Fumble the Pray Test, you have offended your god and must
                            roll on the Wrath of the Gods table.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Limitations</h4>
                        <p>
                            You must be able to speak to intone the required prayer, rite, chant, or song to enact a
                            Blessing or Miracle. Each of your Blessings or Miracles can only be in effect once, meaning
                            you have to wait for an existing one to come to an end before using the same prayer again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Multiple invocations of the same prayer by different individuals do not offer cumulative
                            bonuses. Thus, intoning two <divineman>Blessings of Finesse</divineman> will only provide a
                            bonus of +10 to Dexterity.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="w3-col s12 m12 l5">
                        <h3>Sin Points</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Blessed are watched closely by the gods, and risk gaining the disfavour of their deities
                            if they should act contrary to their gods’ will. In game, this is represented with Sin
                            points.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you violate any of the Cult Strictures listed under your god, the GM will award one or
                            more Sin Points. Every time you receive a Sin point, it is added it to your running total.
                            There is no maximum to the number of Sin points you can earn. The more points you have, the
                            more upset your god is likely to be should you call upon divine aid.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Sin and Wrath</h4>
                        <p>
                            Appealing to your deity when you have been acting contrary to the god’s wishes is risky.
                            Whenever you make a Pray Test, if the units die of the result is equal to or less than your
                            current Sin point total, then you will suffer the <a
                                href="./religion.html#wrathOfGods">Wrath of the Gods</a>, even if the Pray Test is
                            successful.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Penance</h4>
                        <p>
                            Some Wrath of the Gods results require penance. The GM can decide upon a suitable penance
                            depending on your misdeed, or they may prefer you to choose your own penance, with further
                            punishment awaiting if you are insufficiently penitent. Examples of typical penances are
                            listed in each cult description. Penances may come in the form of a vision, divine
                            inspiration or, very rarely, by direct communication from your deity. If you are not worthy
                            of such contact, a penance may be conveyed through another member of your cult.
                            Alternatively, a Divine Servant of the cult could manifest — this could be a dead teacher, a
                            figure of legend, or an appropriate animal — and inform you what is required. The GM should
                            consider the sins involved, and how the god in question would likely react to these.

                        <h3>Appearance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Blessings are subtle, completely imperceptible to those without the <talent>Holy Visions
                            </talent> Talent, their manifestation usually indistinguishable to good fortune. In this
                            way, Clerics of the Old World without the <talent>Blessing</talent> Talent often appear to
                            be as effective as those with it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By comparison, Miracles are overtly manifest, always accompanied by holy signs and portents,
                            which should reflect the circumstances and relevant deity. For instance, an Ulrican Miracle
                            may be accompanied by a chill wind and the spectral howl of wolves, while those receiving a
                            Miracle of Manann may find themselves drenched in saltwater.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Blessings</h3>
                        <p>
                            Blessings are minor manifestations of divine will; a character with the <talent>Bless
                            </talent> Talent receives all six Blessings for their cult as listed in Blessings by Cult.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Success Levels</h4>
                        <p>
                            For every +2 SL you score in a Pray Test when attempting a Blessing, you may choose one of
                            the following benefits:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Range: </b>+6 yards</li>
                            <li><b>Targets: </b>+1</li>
                            <li><b>Duration: </b>+6 Rounds</li>
                        </ul>
                        If the Blessing in question has a Duration of ‘Instant’, you may not extend the Duration. You
                        may choose the same option more than once. For instance, if you rolled +4 SL on a <divineman>
                            Blessing of Healing</divineman>, you could heal three targets you were touching, two targets
                        up to 6 yards away, or one target up to 12 yards away.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="w3-col s12 m12 l5">
                        <h3>Miracles</h3>
                        <p>
                            Miracles are major manifestations of a god’s will, awe-inspiring events everyone will
                            notice; a character with the Invoke Talent can empower one of the Miracles for their cult
                            from the following lists.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Success Levels</h4>
                        <p>
                            For every 2 Success Levels you achieve in a Miracle Pray test, you may add additional range,
                            duration or targets equal to the initial value listed in the Miracle. So, a Miracle with a
                            range of 50 yards could be increased by an extra +50 yards for every +2 SL scored.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Miracles with a Range and Target of ‘You’ may only target the Blessed Priest making the Pray
                            Test, and can never have the range or targets increased. Similarly, if the Miracle has no
                            duration, there is no benefit in choosing to extend its duration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Certain Miracles may have additional, optional, benefits for additional SL written into
                            their descriptions.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Names</h3>
                        <p>
                            Each Cult has unique names for every Blessing and Miracle — sometimes more than one name.
                            For instance, the Cult of Sigmar may refer to the <divineman>Blessing of Battle</divineman>
                            as ‘The Litany of Sigmar’s Wrath’, while the Cult of Ulric may call it ‘The Sharp Bite of
                            Winter’. The words spoken will be different, but the end effect will be the same.
                        </p>
                        <div class="w3-panel w3-light-blue w3-leftbar w3-rightbar w3-border-blue w3-round-large">
                            <h4>Options: Preach It, Sister!</h4>
                            <p>Each of the gods have different styles of prayers, designed to be intoned in different
                                ways. Whether these are the warcries of Ulric, the shanties of Manaan, or the threnodies
                                of Morr, each requires the words be spoken (or sung) firmly, and with conviction. </p>
                            <p>To represent this, the GM may require that any Pray Tests that are intoned quietly or
                                without confidence have a higher Difficulty.</p>
